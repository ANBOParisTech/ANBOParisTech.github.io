## Superlubricity of Graphene Induced by Mussel Adhesive Protein Interlayer

<font color="gray" size = "3">May 2019 - Present</font>

<b>This is the topic of my master thesis and I am still working on it.</b> The mussel adhesive protein is an effective bioadhesive with wide spectrum, linking organic tissue with glass, plastics and metals. Mussel adhesive protein interlayer is prepared on SiO2 substrate by immersing the substrate into protein solution. Graphene is put on this interlayer by two methods. The first method is mechanical exfoliation where we transfer graphene flakes from adhesive tape to SiO2 substrate. The second method is to put a droplet of graphene solution onto the substrate and dry it in the open air. The former shows better graphene condition than the latter: larger and thinner flakes, no clustering, out-of-plane orientation. When we characterize the graphene flakes with AFM, in both cases, we observe a coefficient of friction as low as 0.004. The wear resistance at step edge of the flakes is also increased. At present, on the one hand, we are testing if this phenomenon can be observed on other substrates, including steel and titanium alloy; on the other hand, we are simulating this effect using molecular dynamics simulations.


## Influence of Stone-Wales Defect on Graphene Friction

<font color="gray" size = "3">Oct 2018 - May 2019</font>

By using molecular dynamics simulation, we reveal that Stone-Wales defect increases the friction of graphene. This influence is anisotropic and is more significant along the long axis of the defect. The friction enhancement results from two distinctive mechanisms. One is the pinning effect between several tip bottom atoms and the heptagons. In this case, the potential barrier of heptagons is larger than hexagons, and therefore the resistance is increased when a tip atom passes above these rings. The other mechanism is that the strong resistance to out-of-plane deformation leads to higher pucker beside the defect at certain moments and thus modifies the configuration of wrinkle. This study provides new insight into the atomic scale friction of defective graphene.
