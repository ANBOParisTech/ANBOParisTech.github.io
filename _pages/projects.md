## Superlubricity of Graphene Induced by Mussel Adhesive Protein Interlayer

<font color="gray" size = "3">May 2019 - Present</font>

<b>This is the topic of my master thesis and I am still working on it.</b> The mussel adhesive protein is an effective bioadhesive with wide spectrum, linking organic tissue with glass, plastics and metals. Mussel adhesive protein interlayer is prepared on SiO2 substrate by immersing the substrate into protein solution. Graphene is put on this interlayer by two methods. The first method is mechanical exfoliation where we transfer graphene flakes from adhesive tape to SiO2 substrate. The second method is to put a droplet of graphene solution onto the substrate and dry it in the open air. The former shows better graphene condition than the latter: larger and thinner flakes, no clustering, out-of-plane orientation. When we characterize the graphene flakes with AFM, in both cases, we observe a coefficient of friction as low as 0.004. The wear resistance at step edge of the flakes is also increased. At present, on the one hand, we are testing if this phenomenon can be observed on other substrates, including steel and titanium alloy; on the other hand, we are simulating this effect using molecular dynamics simulations.


## Influence of Stone-Wales Defect on Graphene Friction

<font color="gray" size = "3">Oct 2018 - May 2019</font>

By using molecular dynamics simulation, we reveal that Stone-Wales defect increases the friction of graphene. This influence is anisotropic and is more significant along the long axis of the defect. The friction enhancement results from two distinctive mechanisms. One is the pinning effect between several tip bottom atoms and the heptagons. In this case, the potential barrier of heptagons is larger than hexagons, and therefore the resistance is increased when a tip atom passes above these rings. The other mechanism is that the strong resistance to out-of-plane deformation leads to higher pucker beside the defect at certain moments and thus modifies the configuration of wrinkle. This study provides new insight into the atomic scale friction of defective graphene.

## Car Handbrake Bracket Design and Optimization

<font color="gray" size = "3">Oct 2018 - Jan 2019</font>

A car company want to design a car handbrake bracket under several limits on force, deformation and installation. We design this product by topology optimization using HyperWorks. The price is estimated using information available on the market. The final design fulfills all the requirements at an acceptable price. As the training part of this project, we are also required to optimize a beam of composite materials using dimension optimization.

## Thermal Stability and Crystal Orientation of Sputtered Platinum Films on Different Substrates

<font color="gray" size = "3">May 2018 - Aug 2018</font>

Graphene has attracted much attention in the field of spintronics for its long spin diffusion length. Graphene/Co/Pt(111) has been studied and the magnetic anisotropy was found to be enhanced by the interaction between graphene and Co. To reduce the cost to prepare this promising material, the possibility to replace the bulk single-crystal Pt(111) with an epitaxial high quality Pt(111) thin film prepared on a commercial substrate is studied. Pt thin films with the thickness of 10 nm are grown on MgO(111), Al2O3(0001), SiO2(2 nm)(001)/Si and SiO2(300 nm)(001)/Si substrates by sputtering deposition. Atomic force microscopy(AFM) and X-ray diffraction(XRD) show that the thin films are very homogeneous and the roughness of the surface is low. The Pt/SiO2(2 nm)(001)/Si and Pt/Al2O3(0001) samples are annealed in ultrahigh vacuum at 700K for 30 min. According to AFM and XRD characterization, the former undergoes dewetting and interdiffusion so that the Pt thin film is destroyed. High quality epitaxial Pt thin film with the (111) plane parallel to the substrate is grown on Al2O3(0001) after annealing. These thin films appear suitable for the growth of graphene with well-controlled crystallinity.

## Measurement of Fan and Turbine Noise

<font color="gray" size = "3">Jan 2018 - Apr 2018</font>

Turbine noise is a problem when wind farms are built in France. To study how the noise can be controlled, we use a fan to simulate a turbine and study the noise in different directions and at different distance. The influence of some parameters including the rotation speed and the inclination of fan blades are studied. The faster the rotation and the larger the inclination, the larger the noise.
