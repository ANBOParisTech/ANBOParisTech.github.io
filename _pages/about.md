I am a master student from <font color="#20B2AA"><a href="http://speit.sjtu.edu.cn/indexen.html/">SJTU-ParisTech Elite Institute of Technology</a></font> of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. I major in mechanical engineering and I will graduate in March, 2020. I have also acquired a Diplôme d'Ingénieur (master degree in engineering) at <font color="#20B2AA"><a href="http://www.ensta-paris.fr/en">ENSTA ParisTech</a></font>, France. My research inerests are mainly concentrated on <b>Microtribology, Multi-scale Simulations, and Life-span Analysis of Micro-systems</b>. I have been working on

 * Superlubricity of Graphene Induced by Mussel Adhesive Protein Interlayer
 * Influence of Stone-Wales Defect on Graphene Friction
 * Thermal Stability and Crystal Orientation of Sputtered Platinum Films on Different Substrates
 * Car Handbrake Bracket Design and Optimization

I have learned to manipulate multiple devices, such as SEM, AFM, Raman spectroscopy and XRD, and prepare samples by electrophoresis, sputtering deposition, chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. I am proficient in molecular dynamics simulation, using softwares including LAMMPS, VMD and Ovito. The simulation and experiment data is usually analyzed in Python and MATLAB. I also have experience in finite element analysis by simulating with ANSYS, HyperWorks and COMSOL. I can read documents, write papers and talk with other researchers in English with no difficulty. I am also fluent in French and I have studied in France for two years.
